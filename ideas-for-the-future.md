#Ideas for the future:

**gradient** - https://www.facebook.com/groups/459085124197658/permalink/601164619989707/?comment_id=602428879863281

calculate a (perhaps smoothed out) 
(of course discrete not continuous) 
**gradient/derivative/change-in-time** so a
 
`(d/dt) (marketcap, volume, supply)`

... with that, a lot can be done -->

* First ideas, of course, is ARROWS instead of DISCS, pointing into the direction of that timederivative.

* Another cool way with this timederivative would be an exponentially falling grayscale of the label,
  * i.e. when the timederivative is large (suddenly larger marketcap = price jump, or immense increase in volume per timestep, or both) the label is set to deep black...
  * ... And with every timestep it then grays out, if the timederivative is low - or stays black if the timederivate is large again.
  * Sorry for the technical explanation, do you see what I mean? That way, our fakevolumesuperprofitcoin PFC would have been suddenly labelled pitchblack, because it had so much action in that one time slice.
  * And all those boring nothing-new-happens-only-the-same-that-happened-yesterday coins ... would get slowly graying labels, and thus move to the background of perception. 
  * It would then make sense to draw them in the sequence of light gray to dark black, then the boring coins are overprinted by the radically changed markets.


**Timeline Discussion** 

What I found really fruitful for the investment side of it, were the discussions below each of your updated snapshots. Several people see more than one, and when I had noted some coins popping out of the background, and mentioned them, others commented with their knowledge about them. That really helped.  I have just fiddled a little bit with the youtube annotations function: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jfU_Z9nJYc  But I am not sure if that can be opened wide enough so that visitors can also comment on the timeline. Soundcloud is providing that function, for audio. Comments are located on the timeline.
