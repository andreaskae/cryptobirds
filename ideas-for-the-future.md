**gradient** - https://www.facebook.com/groups/459085124197658/permalink/601164619989707/?comment_id=602428879863281

calculate a (perhaps smoothed out) 
(of course discrete not continuous) 
**gradient/derivative/change-in-time** so a
 
`(d/dt) (marketcap, volume, supply)`

... with that, a lot can be done -->

* First ideas, of course, is ARROWS instead of DISCS, pointing into the direction of that timederivative.

* Another cool way with this timederivative would be an exponentially falling grayscale of the label,
  * i.e. when the timederivative is large (suddenly larger marketcap = price jump, or immense increase in volume per timestep, or both) the label is set to deep black...
  * ... And with every timestep it then grays out, if the timederivative is low - or stays black if the timederivate is large again.
  * Sorry for the technical explanation, do you see what I mean? That way, our fakevolumesuperprofitcoin PFC would have been suddenly labelled pitchblack, because it had so much action in that one time slice.
  * And all those boring nothing-new-happens-only-the-same-that-happened-yesterday coins ... would get slowly graying labels, and thus move to the background of perception. 
  * It would then make sense to draw them in the sequence of light gray to dark black, then the boring coins are overprinted by the radically changed markets.
