## A Birds Eye View of Crypto Currencies = coinmarketcap table --> to image --> to video

When by Anders Brun provided a **self-service version of his coinmarketcap plots**, that are created every 5 minutes:  http://bit.ly/1BfZmze 

... and after we had had long discussions about the pictures & videos & interpretations 
* in FB group "Cryptocurrency Collectors Club": https://www.facebook.com/groups/459085124197658/ 
* The beginning, December 15th: https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10152537991089562&set=gm.599645046808331
* Continued on December 18th: https://www.facebook.com/groups/459085124197658/permalink/601164619989707/
* self-service version of the plot, December 28th: https://www.facebook.com/groups/459085124197658/permalink/605859516186884/
* Mp4 Video, January 2nd: https://www.facebook.com/groups/459085124197658/permalink/609735312465971/

... with examples for successful detection, and interpretations:
* PFC
  * 50 BTC volume blink https://www.facebook.com/groups/459085124197658/permalink/601164619989707/?comment_id=601171813322321
  * 1184 BTC volume https://www.facebook.com/groups/459085124197658/permalink/601164619989707/?comment_id=601530266619809
  * ... and a few hours later, we could have doubled our money. https://www.facebook.com/groups/459085124197658/permalink/601164619989707/?comment_id=601531306619705
* LXC
  * When with the help of the plots, I noticed strong LXC movements around winter solstice, I bought some, and sold most during xmas, at a 65% plus. 
  * I still have 44% left of it ... If I sold all immediately, I would have made a 41% plus overall.
  * Or - if I subtract my realized profits from the expenses, then I got my remaining LXC for 612 Satoshi - but the last bittrex price is 3601.
  * My first mentioning of LXC was 21st of December: 
https://www.facebook.com/groups/459085124197658/permalink/601164619989707/?comment_id=602428016530034
  * Strong >200% price bursts 3 days later: https://www.facebook.com/groups/459085124197658/permalink/601164619989707/?comment_id=603668313072671

... but there were still only animGifs (which cannot be rewound):
* animGif, first ever http://bit.ly/1ABl40a (December 16th)
* animGif http://bit.ly/1zBwCkJ (December 18th)
* animGif http://bit.ly/13Q8eS3 (December 21st)
* animGif http://bit.ly/1BeyOy6  (December 27th)

**... I decided to create my own Python code here in this [github repository] (https://github.com/andreaskae/cryptobirds)**
  * to use his self-service plots at http://bit.ly/1BfZmze , and build on top: 
  * [downloadRepeater.py] (cryptobirds/downloadRepeater.py)
  * [png2movie.py] (cryptobirds/png2movie.py)
  

... and uploaded a resulting video to youtube:
* mp4 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jfU_Z9nJYc (January 2nd)
* Youtube Downloader:
  * userscript (greasemonkey/tampermonkey/violentmonkey/ninjakit) http://wiki.greasespot.net/Cross-browser_userscripting 
  * savefrom downloader userscript http://savefrom.net/user.php?helper=userjs


**By now, Anders is creating videos on the fly, every 1 hour:**
* scroll down here: http://bit.ly/1BfZmze  

Only some of my many suggestions:
* [ideas-for-the-future.md](ideas-for-the-future.md)

*Please comment below the videos* whatever your wetware pattern recognition system identifies as some interesting signal; a coin behaving strangely, the volume (up-down) suddenly rising, strong left-right movements (usually due to price changes), color changes, suddenly appearing and disappearing coins, newcomers, etc. - Then we can look into the time series, and the fundamentals of that coin. **And perhaps make some money :-)** . 

Thanks for the plots to Anders Brun.
