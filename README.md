Some examples for successful detection, and interpretations:
* PFC
  * 50 BTC volume blink https://www.facebook.com/groups/459085124197658/permalink/601164619989707/?comment_id=601171813322321

* LXC
  * When with the help of the plots, I noticed strong LXC movements around winter solstice, I bought some, and sold most during xmas, at a 65% plus. 
  * I still have 44% left of it ... If I sold all immediately, I would have made a 41% plus overall.
  * Or - if I subtract my realized profits from the expenses, then I got my remaining LXC for 612 Satoshi - but the last bittrex price is 3601.
  * My first mentioning of LXC was 21st of December:

*Please comment below the videos* if your wetware pattern recognition system identifies some interesting signal; a coin behaving strangely, the volume (up-down) suddenly rising, strong left-right movements (usually due to price changes), color changes, suddenly appearing and disappearing coins, newcomers, etc. - Then we can look into the time series, and the fundamentals of that coin. **And perhaps make some money :-)** .
